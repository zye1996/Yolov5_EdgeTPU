// This class represents a top level inference request that is created by the
// runtime user. It may have an arbitrary batch size. Its responsibility is to
// sanity check the request and populate TPU requests that can be sent to the
// device as well as tracking their completion.
//
// This is a stateful class. Here's the execution pattern.
//   1. Construction (state: kInitial)
//   2. AddInput() and AddOutput() (can be multiple times) from API interface.
//      (state: kInitial)
//   3. SetDone() in runtime (state: kInitial)
//   4. Prepare() in runtime (kInitial state changes to kPrepared).
//   5. PrepareTpuRequest() in runtime as many times as
//      RequiredTpuRequestCount() (State: kPrepared).
//   6. Done callback is called when request finishes (state changes from
//      // kPrepared to kDone).
